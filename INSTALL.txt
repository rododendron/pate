║ Pâté Installation Instructions ║
╚════════════════════════════════╝

Pâté requires that you have installed:

  ∙ Qt4
  ∙ KDE4
  ∙ sip
  ∙ PyQt4
  ∙ PyKDE4
  ∙ Kate

Most Linux distributions should provide packages for these. More details on
which specific packages are required for different distros is listed below.

In the directory that you extracted Pâté, run

 $ cd build
 $ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$(kde4-config --prefix)
 $ make
 # make install (as root)

The plugins are not automatically installed for now. To install them, simply
move them into the Kate application folder in a pate subdirectory, e.g.

 $ cd ..
 $ cp -r src/plugins $(kde4-config --localprefix)/share/apps/kate/pate

 ∙ openSUSE 10.3

   1. Add the KDE:KDE4 stable repository by visiting http://en.opensuse.org/KDE4,
      clicking on the One-Click Install button, and following the wizard that follows.
   2. Install kde4-kate-devel and python-qt4 using YaST or zypper
      (e.g by running 'zypper install kde4-kate-devel python-qt4').
      Doing so should pull in all other necessary dependancies.
   3. As of the time of writing (26/02/2008) there are no PyKDE4 bindings in the repository,
      which is fairly criminal. You'll have to compile PyKDE4 yourself for now.

Also email me in the likely event that I have made a mistake with the instructions!

Enjoy Pâté!
